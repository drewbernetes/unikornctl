# Where this file comes from...

In a word copied from `github.com/eschercloudai/unikorn/pkg/server/generated/client.go`.

## Why not reference the repo directly??

Because it's private.

While a `GOPRIVATE=github.com/eschercloudai` will work nicely on your laptop, I don't think it will "just work" in an action.
This involves PATs from what I can see, and they have a limited lifespan...
